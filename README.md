# coding-practicum-haskell

This is a blank project of our coding practicum with code removed.
The practicum takes some time to build which may take away from actually solving the problems.
Please build follow these steps and build the project in advance, and when the practicum is released to you then it should build much faster.

## Setup

### Locally

1. Install Haskell tooling: https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/
1. Answer Y to installing stack and LSP
1. Answer P to prepending to path
1. Install VSCode (Optional)
